TC Optimizing Compiler 0.4.2
============================

[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/piotr-skotnicki/tc-optimizer?color=blue)](https://github.com/piotr-skotnicki/tc-optimizer/releases/latest)

Introduction
------------

TC is an automatic source-to-source optimizing compiler for affine loop nests, generating sequential or parallel tiled code based on the application of the transitive closure of a data dependence graph, and combining the *Polyhedral Model* and *Iteration Space Slicing* frameworks. TC utilizes a state-of-the-art polyhedral compilation toolchain, which is:

- Polyhedral Extraction Tool [\[3\]](#references) for extracting polyhedral representations of original loop nests,
- Integer Set Library [\[1\]](#references) for performing dependence analysis, manipulating sets and relations, as well as generating output code,
- Barvinok library [\[2\]](#references) for calculating set cardinality and processing its representation.

In order to optimize a loop nest, one should be surrounded by the `#pragma scop` and `#pragma endscop` directives:

```c
int main()
{
  int N;
  int A[N+2][N+2];
#pragma scop
  for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
S1:   A[i][j] = A[i][j+1] + A[i+1][j] + A[i+1][j-1];
    }
  }
#pragma endscop
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The source file containing the loop nest should be valid C code, and simplified as much as possible. Array accesses must not exceed array bounds. Since version 0.3.0, iterators of a for loop must be declared inside that for loop itself, otherwise they will create a dependency for outer loops.

TC implements a number of tiling transformation algorithms as well as schedulers and code generators (including parallel generators utilizing OpenMP), all available to choose from through command line options. One is encouraged to experiment with various combinations of tiling schemes, schedulers and code generators, as well as tile sizes and transitive closure algorithms.

> [!NOTE]
> TC is primarily used for studying algorithms utilizing transitive closure. Despite being able to generate efficient tiled code, some features are still in development.

For the example loop nest, the correction technique can be applied with a tile size of 32x32:

```c
/* TC Optimizing Compiler 0.4.2 */
/* ./tc ../examples/other/correction.scop.c --correction-tiling --lex-scheduling --serial-codegen -b 32 */
#define min(x,y)    ((x) < (y) ? (x) : (y))
#define max(x,y)    ((x) > (y) ? (x) : (y))
#define floord(n,d) (((n)<0) ? -((-(n)+(d)-1)/(d)) : (n)/(d))
#pragma scop
for (int ii0 = 0; ii0 <= floord(N - 1, 32); ii0 += 1) {
  for (int ii1 = 0; ii1 <= (N - 1) / 32; ii1 += 1) {
    for (int i0 = 32 * ii0 + 1; i0 <= min(N, 32 * ii0 + 32); i0 += 1) {
      for (int i1 = max(1, 32 * ii0 + 32 * ii1 - i0 + 2); i1 <= 32 * ii1; i1 += 1) {
        A[i0][i1] = ((A[i0][i1 + 1] + A[i0 + 1][i1]) + A[i0 + 1][i1 - 1]);
      }
      if (32 * ii1 + 32 >= N) {
        for (int i1 = 32 * ii1 + 1; i1 <= N; i1 += 1) {
          A[i0][i1] = ((A[i0][i1 + 1] + A[i0 + 1][i1]) + A[i0 + 1][i1 - 1]);
        }
      } else {
        for (int i1 = 32 * ii1 + 1; i1 <= 32 * ii0 + 32 * ii1 - i0 + 33; i1 += 1) {
          A[i0][i1] = ((A[i0][i1 + 1] + A[i0 + 1][i1]) + A[i0 + 1][i1 - 1]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
#pragma endscop
```

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to enable the `--debug` command-line option, not only to inspect intermediate representations of the sets, but also to monitor the progress of the compilation pipeline.

User guide
----------

### Getting started

Effective use of the offered capabilities requires some level of expertise in identifying loop nest classes or a series of trial-and-error attempts of combining the available options. In the process of finding an optimal transformation, the below procedure should prove helpful:

1. The best starting point is `--correction-tiling`. The algorithm corrects the rectangular tiles if necessary, without the overhead of identifying strongly connected components. Experiments with other options should follow only after generating the code for this scheme and finding the results suboptimal.
2. The number of synchronization-free slices found by `--sfs-single-scheduling` / `--sfs-multiple-scheduling` / `--sfs-tile-scheduling` should offer greatest scalability. If the degree of parallelism is not satisfactory, `--free-scheduling` uses topological traversal instead. `--isl-wave-scheduling` is an option for pipelined execution.
3. The `--iterative-tc` method was found to be the most versatile and should be preferred over other algorithms. `--isl-map-tc` is the secondary option if the iterative approach fails to produce a result within a reasonable time frame.
4. If any of the transitive closure algorithms returns an inexact form, another algorithm may succeed instead. Note that `--omega-map-tc` may produce an under-approximation leading to invalid results and in general should be the last option to consider.
5. The `--debug` command-line option allows to monitor the progress of the compilation pipeline by emitting all intermediate results.
6. Experimenting with tile sizes of `-b 32`, `-b 64`, `-b 16`, in that order of evaluation, should indicate if the tile size should increase or decrease.

### Troubleshooting

```
./tc: No such file or directory
```

**Meaning:**
The compiler was not built or the working directory is invalid.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you have followed the [Installation](#Installation) guide and the build was successful.
- Change the working directory to the `src` folder.

```
error: no such file or directory
```

**Meaning:**
The input file does not exist or the path is invalid.

**Solution:**
- Check the path to the input file.

```
Error: No SCoP was found in file
```

**Meaning:**
The input file exists, but a loop nest was not found.

**Solution:**
- Verify if the input file is valid C code.
- Identify the loop nest and add `#pragma scop`/`#pragma endscop` directives around it.

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

**Meaning:**
A fatal error has caused the process to crash.

**Solution:**
- Reconfigure TC with the `--enable-debug=yes` parameter and rebuild the project, or add `CFLAGS="-O0 -g"` to configuration flags.
- Attach a debugger or analyze the core file.

```
Error: Backward relation detected.
```

**Meaning:**
The inter-tile relation is not lexicographically forward, therefore the resultant tiling scheme does not allow for lexicographic execution of tiles, or the hyper-rectangular tiling is not valid for the dependence pattern.

**Solution:**
- Use another scheduling algorithm, i.e., `--free-scheduling`, `--free-rk-scheduling`, `--isl-wave-scheduling`, `--isl-scheduling`.
- Choose a tiling algorithm other than `--rectangular-tiling`.
- Use a tiling algorithm that ensures lexicographic execution order, i.e., `--correction-tiling`, `--inv-correction-tiling`, `--split-tiling`.

```
Warning: Inexact R^+. The results can be non-optimal. Restart TC with a different transitive closure method.
```

**Meaning:**
Computing the transitive closure has resulted in an overapproximation that may degrade tiling quality or limit parallelism.

**Solution:**
- Continue the compilation pipeline typing `y` in the console.
- or, restart the compilation with another transitive closure algorithm.

```
Error: Missing required option
```

**Meaning:**
One of the command-line parameters is missing an associated value.

**Solution:**
- Check the proper syntax consulting the `./tc --help` output.
